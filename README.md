# Pilosa

A CLI tool that takes a folder of source files and turns it into a searchable knowledge map for multi-agent research workflows.

## What it does

1. Copies your source files into a workspace (`raw/`)
2. Generates YAML headers for each file
3. Creates navigation maps with wikilinks between files
4. Provides an orchestrator (`AGENTS.md`) that routes questions to specialist sub-agents

The original source folder is never modified. The workspace is self-contained.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/TommasoPrinetti/pilosa/releases/download/v0.4.1/install.sh | bash
```

This installs the pinned stable version (`0.4.1`) to `~/.pilosa/`. No npm, Python, or Go required.

For more options:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/TommasoPrinetti/pilosa/releases/download/v0.4.1/install.sh -o install-pilosa.sh
bash install-pilosa.sh --version 0.4.1
bash install-pilosa.sh --min-days 7
bash install-pilosa.sh --verify-only
```

## Quick start

### 1. Create a workspace

```bash
pilosa new /path/to/source/folder
```

This runs the onboarding flow:
- Scans the source folder for file types
- Creates a sibling folder `<name>-pilosa/` as the workspace
- Lets you pick which file types to import
- Converts PDFs to Markdown (if `pdftotext` is installed)
- Copies a startup prompt to your clipboard

### 2. Run the startup workflow

Point your LLM CLI (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, etc.) at the workspace folder and paste the prompt. The LLM will:

1. Read project context and build a dictionary from `raw/`
2. Generate YAML headers for every raw file
3. Create navigation maps in `maps/` with wikilinks
4. Validate headers and map links
5. Write a startup report to `agent_reports/`

### 3. Ask questions

After startup, ask research questions normally. The orchestrator routes them through sub-agents.

## Dashboard

Run `pilosa` without arguments to open the interactive dashboard:

```bash
pilosa
```

Available options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| New workspace | Create a new workspace and run onboarding |
| Onboard workspace | Run onboarding on an existing workspace |
| Update workspace | Update workspace framework files |
| Check workspace | Validate workspace integrity |
| Sync agents | Sync agent and skill mirrors |
| Upgrade Pilosa | Upgrade to latest release |
| System health | Check system health and environment |
| Uninstall | Remove Pilosa from this system |
| Help | Show help information |

## Commands

### `pilosa new [directory]`

Create a new workspace and run onboarding. If no directory is given, you are prompted for the path.

```bash
pilosa new /path/to/source
```

Flags: `--gum`, `--no-gum`, `--no-color`, `--help`

### `pilosa onboard [workspace]`

Re-run onboarding on an existing workspace.

```bash
pilosa onboard /path/to/workspace
```

### `pilosa update [workspace]`

Update workspace framework files. Shows a plan and asks for confirmation.

```bash
pilosa update /path/to/workspace
pilosa update  # if inside a workspace
```

Flags: `--version X.Y.Z`, `--dry-run`, `--yes`, `--help`

### `pilosa upgrade`

Upgrade the Pilosa CLI to the latest release.

```bash
pilosa upgrade
pilosa upgrade --yes
```

### `pilosa check [workspace]`

Validate workspace integrity. Checks required files, source location, and map coverage.

```bash
pilosa check /path/to/workspace
pilosa check  # if inside a workspace
```

### `pilosa sync`

Regenerate vendor-specific agent mirrors and sync skills from canonical sources.

```bash
pilosa sync
```

### `pilosa health`

Check system health and environment.

```bash
pilosa health
```

### `pilosa uninstall`

Remove Pilosa from your system. Does not affect research workspaces.

```bash
pilosa uninstall
pilosa uninstall --yes
```

## Security

- The installer uses a **pinned stable version**, not `latest`
- SHA-256 checksums are verified for the framework tarball and vendor binaries
- Minimum release age can be enforced with `--min-days`
- Verify-only mode audits an existing install without reinstalling

```

## Rules

- Do not edit `raw/`, maps, dictionary, logs, or system files directly
- `connects_to` lists in YAML frontmatter stay at 3-5 entries
- File retirement goes to `.trash/`, not `rm`

---

## Development

### Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TommasoPrinetti/pilosa.git
cd pilosa
```

### Branch strategy

- **`main`** - stable framework, tagged releases only
- **`dev`** - active development
- **`<name>`** - project workspace branch (from `dev`)

```bash
git checkout -b my-project dev
git push -u origin my-project
```

### Sync agents

```bash
pilosa sync
```

### Tests

```bash
bash tests/test_cli.sh
```

### Packaging a release

```bash
bash .bin/package-release.sh 0.4.1
```

### Publishing a release

```bash
bash .bin/publish-release.sh 0.4.1
```

Requires `gh` CLI and a clean working tree.

### Contributing

- Framework changes go to `dev` or a feature branch off `dev`
- Keep `.bin/` scripts pure bash, zero deps
